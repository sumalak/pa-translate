# pa-translate

With these tools you can make your own translation more easily without much handwork. 

## How-to

0. Download ready to use translated prison_architect.po files from [Prison Architect translation project on Zanata.org][zanata-project]. You may be need to [sign up][zanata-sign-up], [join a language][zanata-join-language] and HELP translate game to your native language (you can contact [David Mason][github-davidmason] on Zanata team if you need help).
0. Install Python, Python PIL library, Python Polib library (Python version 2.7.8 or near).
0. Download all scripts from this repository and put them in folder.
0. Open in text editor replace_pattern.txt.
0. Write in first line all characters from your alphabet in upper and lower case.
0. Save and close replace_pattern.txt.
0. Run: python makefont.py
0. Run: python po2prison.py prison_architect.po
0. Run: python native2custom.py base-language.txt.native
0. Open verdana-bold-outline.png and save as verdana-bold-outline.bmp (BMP version 3 and type GrayscaleAlpha).
0. Replace original game fonts here "<game folder>/data/fonts/" with new one from work folder.
0. Replace original game translation here "<game folder>/data/language/" with new one from work folder (you also need to rename base-language.txt.custom to base-language.txt).
0. Run game.

For more detailed description read below.

## po2prison.py

Usage: python po2prison.py prison_architect.po

Dependencies: Python Polib library

Description: Generate translated file base-language.txt.native using provided file prison_architect.po with your own downloaded translation.

## native2custom.py

Usage: python native2custom.py base-language.txt.native

Dependencies: no

Description: Convert all characters with replace pattern from file replace_pattern.txt.

## makefont.py

Usage: python makefont.py

Dependencies: Python PIL library

Description: It generate custom fonts. Right now Python PIL library dont support transparency in BMP format.

## prison2pot.py

Usage: python prison2pot.py base-language.txt

Dependencies: Python Polib library

Description: It convert original file base-language.txt to Gettext template file. I used it to create Gettext template from <game folder>/data/language/base-language.txt and upload it on Zanata.org.

## Additional information

.po file is Gettext format file for helping translators. It is actually .txt format, but it have structured information about translated strings. It may be easily edited. I recommend use Poedit editor (google it). But Gettext is not native format for Prison Architect and i use my own python scripts to convert translated prison_architect.po file to <game folder>/data/language/base-language.txt.

If your game files structure is:

* lib
* lib64
* main.dat
* PrisonArchitect.i686
* PrisonArchitect.x86_64
* sounds.dat

Then you need to unpack main.dat (it is actually a RAR archive) in game folder and rename main.dat to main1.dat (to make game not able to see this file).

Bitmap font parameters:

* catalogue.bmp - Grayscale
* verdana.bmp - Grayscale
* verdana-bold.bmp - Grayscale
* verdana-bold-outlined.bmp - GrayscaleAlpha, BMP3 (Microsoft Windows bitmap image (V3))

GIMP export options: do not save colors, not run-length encoded.

## Story (>áƒš)

Following information about BMP3 with transparency from website of ImageMagick.

> I've installed Xnview and it does indicate that a BMP3 file that I created with nconvert has transparency. So, I looked at a hexdump of the file.
> The BMP3 file header indicates that the image has 32-bits per pixel. Nconvert has used the high byte of each DWORD to indicate the opacity of the pixel. If it is zero, the pixel is transparent and if it is 255 the pixel is fully opaque. I haven't tried to sort out whether Nconvert will produce a BMP3 with partially transparent pixels nor whether Xnview could display one properly.
> However, BMP is a Microsoft file format and the documentation that comes with my C compiler, and also what I have found on Microsoft's website, says that the high byte of each DWORD is unused. Therefore using this byte for opacity (or anything else) is a non-standard use.
> The specific problem that I can see right now is that because Microsoft says that the high byte is unused, programs are free to leave any random value in that byte. How do you then distinguish between a BMP generated by such a program and a BMP which is using that byte as opacity?
> I don't think that Magick (IM's developer) will expend any effort on the BMP coder to handle an apparently undefined/undocumented extension of the BMP format. If you can find documentation of this extension and how it fits in with the existing BMP3 spec maybe it will happen.
